TIME &
DISTANCE
BARRIER


The Universe is BIG. Too big. The distances between stars are too great. The number of galaxies, stars, planets and moons is too great. Actual exploration of the universe is not possible in any practical sense.



“Distances so great as to negate time.”

--- quotation from the B.L.A.S.T. (Beyond
Lightspeed Alternative Space-Time) From
the Past screenplay.

Humans cannot travel at the speed of light (671,000,000 mph) or even any meaningful fraction of lightspeed. We cannot travel at multitudes of the speed of light. We cannot travel through wormholes or near black holes to use the bending of time. 


Even if we could snap our fingers and by some magical means:
 Send 1 million (1,000,000) exploring spaceships
• Across distances of a zillion miles
• Instantly, with zero travel time
• It would still take more than 140 billion (140,000,000,000) years
• Just to briefly check out a mere 1% of the estimated
• 10 septillion planets in the known universe.
10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000!
However, all is not lost. The human race is ingenious. The physical laws of the universe will not stop us!
